# Objectives, modalities and issues of the program
The objective of this program is to exploit the European databases freely available at EU Open Data Portal. Among them, the database CORDIS lists all the projects and organizations funded under the framework-programs.
FP1, FP2, FP3, FP4, FP5, FP6, FP7, FP8/H2020.

The database contains many very interesting information, but sometimes fragmented for older framework programmes.

This program includes several steps.

1 - Import & Concat European Framework-programs datasets from Cordis/ EU open data portal : exemple with FP6

Bonus - Convert adresses into geodatas

2 - Columns' text pre-processing

3 - Database to nodes & edges

4 - Graph : algorithms, stats/ histograms

5 - Graph : visualize networks in Python NetworkX o Gephi
